Upcoming

- Fixed perlbrew installation by installing libdevel-patchperl-perl in
  GitHub runner.

Release 0.7.1 (2024-10-04)
- Added .github/dependabot.yml file to auto-update GitHub actions
- Following a release on 07/09/2024, see https://metacpan.org/dist/App-perlbrew/changes
  the checksum of the script served by https://install.perlbrew.pl had changed.
  https://install.perlbrew.pl is a redirect to raw
  https://github.com/gugod/App-perlbrew/blob/master/perlbrew-install, so
  the change originates from GitHub and can be trusted. Our CI flow compares
  the checksum of the downloaded script to the expected value. We now store
  an updated expected checksum value, which corresponds to the latest release.
